Thankfully there's a pretty good example to borrow elements from, bunch given my lack of artistic ability I'd imagine this thing will just look horrifying.

Things to add are:
Balloon/Balloon string
    Making an Ellipse with a line dropping down from it, seems pretty simple, just have to finagle with the location.
Party Hat
    Make a triangle and place it onto of the head ellipse 
Hat Spots
    Make small ellipses and make sure to place them in the triangle that represents the hat, color choice doesn't really matter
Making the eyes follow the mouse
    This is also pretty much following what was taught, 
"Hair"
    The stroke weight is actually somewhat interesting, too thick and it'll just consume everything, PI commands to get it to stick onto the "head"
"A click effect"
    gonna put it on the nose and tounge, make it a simple color change and that'll fulfill the clickable part 
Tounge
    getting half an ellipse will require using the PI/1/2PI commands, trial and error to get what is needed.
    
    
Eyes:
    Make sure the ellipse have ellipses in them, making pupils and corneas both seems excessive(and creepy, even more so than normal.)
face:
    an ellipse for a face and we're good to go!
    
    This wasn't added on the due date, but here it be

Making an image gallery should be relatively easy.

I can take the framework of the interface lessons and use them as my buttons.
Using this array, I can put in several pictures and ideally set it so that everytime I press either button a new picture will show up.
Making sure the buttons will display is a huge part of it, but once I get the buttons working it shouldn't be too hard.

UPDATE:
Okay, lesson learned, making the actual buttons respond took something I didn't even consider, adding ++/-- to make the button go to the next picture in the array. The problem now is getting the thing to stop going forwards/backwards into a the nether. Best look at week 4's array stuff.

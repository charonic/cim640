Surprising notes: 
Actually writing up text that makes this make sense was surprisingly difficult. Making a literal rocks fall and you die was kinda goonish. Also the narrative where you're looking at mirage like locations to cover up the random nature of the game was also a deus ex moment. 

Directions:
Making sure the player can actually travel in four directions with each being a unique location. Each option will let you travel somewhere, and the directions are all in array.

Consequences/Outcomes'
Thankfully I can pull your consequences/locations and expand them, filling more options in the array.

Tje biggest thing here is making sure I remain consistent with what I write when it comes to the many variables here.

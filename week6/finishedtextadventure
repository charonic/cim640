    <h1>Welcome to Die!</h1>

    <p id="message">You wake up and find yourself at a crossroads. <br>To the north you see an ominous mountain.<br> To the south is a dense forest.<br> To the west you catch a whiff of brine. <br>To the east you smell cooking meat. <br><br>
    
    You take each path in turn, but soon enough you realize that reality has decided to take the day off. <br>
    <br>
    
    You blink and for a second you swear the beach has become a mountain has become a village, has become the very crossroads your currently stand at.<br><br>What is happening? How did you get here? How do you get home?<br><br>
    As you decide to continue trying, you find yourself at the crossroads once more.
    <br>
    <br>Which of the constantly shifting options do you take?</p>

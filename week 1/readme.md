## A Short Bio
My name is William Sun. I'm been a Florida native since birth, despite what my curent lack of tan may tell you. I have a Bachelors in Psychology, but chose this graduate program because I decided I'd rather try to polish my skills regarding things I enjoy doing. It is my hope that I'll acquire a set of skills that will allow me to enter a position where I can leverage my creative talents to find a decent paying job.

### Hobbies
Currently I've found that my time is consumed primarily with first person shooter games: Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, and Playerunknown's Battleground. On the side I'm whittling away at a book list that has never actually decreased in size. Due to my current residency in Doral, I've found I've been playing less and less boardgames and card games as there are no local game shops in the area.

### Current Worries
I do want to learn new skills and I understand the rationale as to why the program wants to ensure everyone has the same fundamentals, but until this point in my life I've never actually written any code or prototyped.

#Code Plan:#

##What am I making?:##
This code will take an amount of USD, and convert them into a currency of another kind at the current rate.

### What Do I Need ###
 *  Inputs
    *I need the user to tell me how much USD they plan to convert into the target currency, this should be the only input.
 * Outputs
    * The amount of converted currency. I'll be using around five foreign currencies: 
        * Rubles
        * Rupees
        * Real
        * Euros 
 * A Small Message that will spit out the converted currency amount, given that popup windows aren't elegant I guess I'll just use a small message.
 
 * The Process
    * The user will put their desired amount of USD into a input box corresponding to their target currency. They will then click a button and the USD they       input will be multiplied at the current market ratio.
